# 0x03. Caching


## Background Context

In this project, you learn different caching algorithms.
Resources

#### Read or watch:

- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First_in_first_out_(FIFO))
- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Last_in_first_out_(LIFO)_or_First_in_last_out_(FILO))
- [Cache replacement policies - LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU))
- [Cache replacement policies - MRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Most_recently_used_(MRU))
- [Cache replacement policies - LFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least-frequently_used_(LFU))


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means
- What LIFO means
- What LRU means
- What MRU means
- What LFU means
- What the purpose of a caching system
- What limits a caching system have


## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
